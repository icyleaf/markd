## Alert

Alerts are a Markdown extension based on the blockquote syntax that
you can use to emphasize critical information. On GitHub, they are
displayed with distinctive colors and icons to indicate the significance
of the content.

Use alerts only when they are crucial for user success and limit them
to one or two per article to prevent overloading the reader. Additionally,
you should avoid placing alerts consecutively. Alerts cannot be nested
within other elements.

To add an alert, use a special blockquote line specifying the alert type
and an optional title, followed by the alert information in a standard
blockquote.

There are five types of alert: 

* NOTE
* TIP
* IMPORTANT
* WARNING
* CAUTION

```````````````````````````````` example alert
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.
.
<div class="alert alert-note"><p class="alert-title">NOTE</p>
<p>Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.</p>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

An optional title can be added after the closing bracket.

```````````````````````````````` example alert
> [!NOTE] What is a note?
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.
.
<div class="alert alert-note"><p class="alert-title">What is a note?</p>
<p>Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.</p>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

Empty spaces after the brackets are ignored.

```````````````````````````````` example alert
> [!NOTE]  
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.
.
<div class="alert alert-note"><p class="alert-title">NOTE</p>
<p>Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.</p>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

Alert-like block quotes which don't use one of the five listed
alert types are just block quotes.

```````````````````````````````` example alert
> [!FOO]  
> Not a real alert.
.
<blockquote>
<p>[!FOO]<br />
Not a real alert.</p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````
